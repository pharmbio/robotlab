[ ] gripper
    [ ] raise gripper if close more than expected
[ ] repo
    [ ] move viable and provenance to utils directory
    [x] move arg builder (and Args?) out from cli
    [x] rename main -> main_gui, gui -> moves_gui
[ ] main gui
    [ ] batch sep argument ?
    [ ] add a "is gripper initialized? is remote on?" if robotarm GripperCheck takes too long
    [x] runtime: separate runtime.running into its own log file
    [x] make sure small protocols can be viewed in the gui
    [x] add to gui protocol to load incubator and a few others of the small protocols
    [x] write "success!" when finished
    [x] visualization overflows for 10 plate protocol
    [x] after resuming it still thinks it has an error
[ ] bioteks
    [x] add setup.py
    [x] repo rename cli -> repl
    [ ] check that protocols exists before running: add to biotek cliwrapper to report checksum/hash and last modified date of protocol files
    [ ] check that all LHC protocol files exist before starting, also associate their timings with their last modification date (and perhaps hash?)
    [ ] Validate all protocols before starting cell paint
        [x] validate all protocols small protocol gives no feedback in the main gui
    [ ] overview before starting, make a little summary of LHC files before starting
[ ] commands
    [ ] Command.WaitForCheckpoint: ensure checkpoint name exists
    [ ] improve command names:
        [ ] Duration -> TimeSince
        [ ] exactly ... at_least ... at_most ...
[ ] small_protocols
    [ ] make a load up to 18 plates protocol
[ ] render archive log
    [ ] use biotek pdfs: use updated print_all
    [ ] what to generate? excel? pdf? webpage?
[ ] movelists
    [ ] put/get names not transparent enough ... ? lid_put lid_get
    [ ] moves: both lin&joint for all coords ?
[ ] resume
    [ ] check that it is close to B neu when starting, but don't move there using MoveJoint !!! can check the inverse kinematics of the current position close to B neu
    [ ] remove all neutral MoveJoint, instead check that the robot is roughly correct (??)

[x] incubator: Use get_status instead of get_climate
[x] incubator: Make a reset and activate small protocol

questions from the presentation:
[ ] slack notifications
[ ] temperature etc (of room, of incubator) periodically put into the log (?)
    anders seems to have had such a system at some point with an arduino, ask!

january:
[x] add the pause/slowdown button

bioteks:
    [x] make it easier to work with the windows computer? right now you have to change user...

misc:
[x] resume: remove removed plate from the world

[x] prio 3. [moves] Raise disp put to be a bit above B21
[x] prio 2. Add test comm before starting cell paint
[x] prio 3. improve logging output. countdown on timers
[x] prio 1. what running information should be printed during run?
[x] prio 1. cover the dispenser with some proper cardboard
[x] prio 3. list all moves that have no est
[x] prio 1. gui: speed setting buttons
[x] prio 1. gui: update to newest viable
[x] prio 1. gui: level RPY

[x] prio 3. timings, how to make them perfect? solution: use z3

[x] moves: Rename all occurrences to h21, r21, out21 to B21, C21, A21 and so on
[x] moves: Convert moves to jsonl

[x] prio 3. robots: test communication with all robots before starting a protocol
[x] prio 3. timings: extract the important parts of the protocol
[x] prio 3. cli: more information while running: current state (what cycle and plate etc)
[x] prio 3. system: improve logging. now using jsonl and measuring non-blocking events properly!
[x] prio 3. protocol: manual delay from command line. right now only auto
[x] prio 3. protocol: make a stress test circuit (put them back in incu again)
[x] prio 3. protocol: prime dispenser pumps
[x] prio 3. protocol: add batching (make it possible to handle 12 plates)
[x] prio 3. protocol: add purge after each mito disp and prime before each mito disp
[x] prio 3. robustness: make sure cobot programs exit cleanly (use the log again)
[x] prio 4. moves: dispenser get move slipped a little !! does the gripper get sufficient power?
[x] prio 3. moves: glue them together properly for protocol
[x] prio 3. moves: use no force on lids
[x] prio 3. gripper: there is a rq_close but it just calls rq_set_pos
[x] prio 3. protocol: make plates go to output hotel
[x] prio 3. protocol/moves: Start washer just after dropoff
[x] prio 3. post mortem: config names are too confusing. try to reduce them
[x] prio 3. lab setup: tell the rest of the group that the incubator position is not fixed !! (of course)

[x] prio 3. moves: fix w->d transfer pick vertical offset
[x] prio 2. moves: wash put move has this really annoying start
[x] prio 2. moves: still some moves with 0.8° roll such as C21. make them level

[x] prio 3. safety, gui: reset LinRel every time last move wasn't LinRel. Right now you can go into freedrive, move the robot arm, then do LinRel moves which moves the robot directly relative to a position _before_ the freedrive. This is dangerous!!
[x] prio 1. gui: grip test: remove grip test button, only have one copy
[x] prio 1. gui: remove to_rel to_abs
[x] prio 1. repo: remove scriptparser, scriptgenerator, copyscripts and scipy dependency
[x] prio 1. repo: rename robocom.sh -> run.sh
[x] prio 1. repo: move LHC_Caller, labrobots-restserver-* to the same repo. This is now robotlab-labrobots
[x] prio 1. network: move robotlab NUCs and cobot to local 10.10.0.* network.
    [x] IPs are changed
    [x] update readme
    [x] update the code with the IPs
    [x] remove source secrets scripts
    [x] check consistency of run.sh
[x] prio 1. system, incu: make a blocking wrapper around incubator so that it can be timed properly
[x] prio 1. system: write runtime errors to log file
[x] prio 1. system: incorporate real robotarm timings into dry run

[x] prio 2. system: the test circuit program does things in quite a confusing order... would be better if it did things more like the CP protocol
[x] prio 2. system ui: how to start ? anders wants a config file but just start with python cli.py --cell-paint 6,6 --live
[x] prio 2. post mortem: why did the six-plates-from-r-to-incu put the plates back the wrong way around?
            someone must have put them the wrong way around in the hotel

[-] prio 2. (wontfix, not possible) washer wrapper: doesn't throw an error properly when out of liquid (but you can notice something is wrong because duration is only 22s, not >100s)

[-] Incubator get does not seem to take different amount of time because of height

- Dealing with runtime failures (machines acting up, gripper failures: plates slipping, lids not correctly on or off)
    - [x] Make a list of all interactions that can error
    - Jonne is compiled a list for the washer and dispenser
    - Sacrifice the least amount of plates
          Remove the failing plate from experiment and manually tell robot
          to proceed but ignore this plate in the rest of the schedule
    - Alert errors somewhere (slack?)

- [ ] Use Rikard's camera to view video after failure
- [x] Anders: Synchronize all server clocks
